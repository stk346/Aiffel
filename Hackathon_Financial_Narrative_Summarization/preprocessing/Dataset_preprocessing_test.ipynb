              "[' VPhase plc   Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 05 Chief Executive’s Review I am delighted to report that the Group has successfully delivered  its key objective of positioning its first product VX1 to be ready for  the next stage of commercialisation in 2009 and to place VX1 in  an Ofgem Demonstration Action programme. This programme  has been fully funded by SSE to a value of up to £240,000, and it  is anticipated that these trials of VX1 will demonstrate significant  carbon dioxide savings when used in UK domestic properties.  Additionally, the Group is starting a programme of commercial  partnerships to introduce VPhase initially to European and then to  other geographic markets. We have already entered into a  memorandum of understanding with British Gas to consider  routes to market for VPhase products in the UK and also into  North America through Direct Energy, one of America’s leading  integrated energy companies and another Centrica-owned  business. We have also initiated dialogue with consumer unit  manufacturers, social housing organisations and energy   efficiency companies. Furthermore, we have examined both technically and commercially  the potential to expand the VPhase technology platform to  additional products and markets. Whilst we are focussed on  delivering the VX1 product, we believe that further products can  be readily produced for delivery into a wider range of geographical  markets such as North America and dedicated to high-end  energy saving applications. We have filed another patent on the basis of development work  carried out that expands the potential footprint, and the protection,  for our Smart Voltage Management technology. The Group has made excellent progress in 2008, having  established an experienced in-house team and working with a  specialist provider for design for manufacture and initial volume  manufacturing services, culminating in the trade launch of the  Group’s first product VX1. The VX1 product was previewed at a trade launch at the Interbuild  Exhibition held in October 2008. Interest in the product and the  principles of Smart Voltage Management was strong from a  broad section of the building and property industry, and the  Group is currently recruiting additional sales resource to respond  to this demand. Our progress in 2008   has been substantial   and provides the  soundest of foundations  for commercial success   in 2009. We are excited about   the relationships we have  built with SSE and British  Gas and are extremely  confident about the  future of VPhase. VPhase announces Ofgem approval for trialing  of the VPhase VX1 product under the UK  Government’s Carbon Emissions Reduction  Target (CERT) scheme in partnership with  Scottish and Southern Energy. “We are looking forward to confirming the  energy and carbon saving capability of the  VPhase VX1 device and subsequently making  the product available to SSE customers.”  Paul Wilkins, Energy Efficiency Team Leader for SSE  VPhase plc signs a memorandum of  understanding with British Gas to distribute   the VPhase energy saving product – subject to  successful trials.  “This MoU is another step in British Gas   putting in place a range of low carbon energy  technologies and products for our residential,  business and public sector customers. These  technologies will become increasingly  important as UK consumers seek to become  more energy efficient.”  Gearoid Lane, Managing Director of British Gas New Energy, leading the  product trials on behalf of British Gas Services 12065 Vphase FRONT.indd   5 17/4/09   19:38:53 VPhase plc   Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 06 We achieved or exceeded  our goals in 2008 and I  look forward to repeating  this success in 2009.

Exhibit at major show. The company exhibited at Interbuild in    2008 and Ecobuild in Q1 2009.  In May 2008, the Group raised £3.5 million (gross) by way of a  placing of 70 million ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each,  comprising 10.1% of the enlarged issued share capital, at a price  of 5 pence per share. This share placing has enabled the Group  to accelerate the time and access to routes to market, and to  investigate other potential opportunities for Smart Voltage  Management, such as further domestic and small commercial  applications and other geographic regions. The Group has teamed with the two biggest utility companies in  the UK who jointly supply energy to around 40% of UK  households.  The Group continues to exercise strong cash management and  ends the year with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet  and a well defined route forward to commercialisation, with a  view to delivering growth and shareholder value. Key priorities for 2009 include the CE marking of VX1; the  expansion of our capacity to supply; capitalising on market  opportunities to generate revenue; and the development of further  products utilising our Smart Voltage Management technology. Overall, we expect 2009 to be another year of progress and  growth for VPhase plc and I look forward to updating you on our  progress at the time of our interims.

We have  also made signiﬁ cant investment in our product portfolio,  both by licensing new technologies to commercialise  and by developing in-house proprietary technologies to  address the needs of mass consumer markets. AIMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Our primary aim this year was to increase our turnover  and profits whilst investing in the business to expand  our product portfolio. We are pleased to report that we  have achieved success in both endeavours. This growth  is a result of continued sales from ONSPEED and a sustained  revenue contribution from our other products.  By developing a number of new routes to market, through  both retail and afﬁ liate partnerships, as well as expanding our  customer base abroad, we have achieved signiﬁ cant sales  growth. In addition, we continue to maintain high customer  retention levels through the provision of unique and affordable  software services and excellent customer support. We have laid the foundations for the future this year through  sizeable investment in research and development. This  has resulted in the recent launch of ONSPEED Mobile and  the release of our revolutionary ﬁ le sharing software OnShare. Our ﬁ rst products Net2Roam and NetAway have provided  a consistent revenue stream, with very little requirement  for additional resources or marketing budget. It has been  through the success of these products that we have also  established strong relationships with distributors and retailers  that have been beneﬁ cial in the development of new routes  to market for ONSPEED both in the UK and abroad. Onbidder was also launched this year, and although  it only accounts for a small percentage of our revenue,  it also sells both online and through retail outlets, further  strengthening the Group’s brand position with major  retailers and consumers alike. ONSPEED has continued to perform very well throughout  the year and we now have over half a million customers.  Online sales have grown, continuing to account for the majority  of sales both in the UK and abroad. Ofﬂ ine sales increased  with the publication of a retail version of ONSPEED, which  is now sold in most major retailers in the UK and Europe.  The Group further developed its Internet acceleration software  for Dial-up and Broadband, with the release in January 2006   07 Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 “ By developing a number  of new routes to market,  through both retail and  afﬁ liate partnerships as  well as expanding our  customer base abroad  we have achieved  signiﬁ cant sales growth.

The addition of ONSPEED Version 5  has allowed us to market the product more effectively to  Broadband customers in addition to the existing Dial-up  customer base. NEW ROUTES TO MARKET Following the success of ONSPEED sales via the web and  the release of the retail version, we have signed a number  of distribution deals for ONSPEED this year. These include  Koch Media, one of Europe’s largest software distributors,  with which we have signed deals in the UK, Germany,  Switzerland, Austria and Italy. In the UK, our retail products  are available in the key software retailers such as PC World,  WH Smith, Game, HMV and Virgin. The product was  successfully chart-tracked in the retail market, a key driver  for establishing good credentials and positioning with  retailers. Signiﬁ cant sales were achieved through this channel,  which opened up the market for ONSPEED to a wider  audience. It has also served well in promoting the ONSPEED  brand to the consumer marketplace. In addition we have distribution deals in place with  companies in the USA, Russia, the rest of Europe, Africa  and Asia. We recognise the need for local support within  international markets and have established relationships  with key local partners, which we have found to be highly   “ When so many programs claim to speed up your net  connection it’s refreshing to ﬁ nd one that actually does it.” .Net magazine  08 Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 “ We are delighted by the  Group’s progress since  admission to AIM and  this is, in large part, due  to the skill and hard work  of our employees.” beneficial in supporting sales growth. The demand  for products such as ONSPEED is very high in these  countries, with the majority of Internet users still on  Dial-up connections. During the year, the Group has established itself within  the international retail sector and retail sales now account  for 18% of turnover. Our strong relationships with the  major retailers will stand us in good stead for future  product releases, including ONSPEED Mobile and  OnShare. Distribution deals are already lined up for the  retail version of ONSPEED Mobile as well as a number  of consumer-focused gaming software products. ONLINE AND AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIPS This year we formed a number of new afﬁ liate partnerships  and consolidated existing ones. Our deal with BT has  continued to drive sales and we have signed new ISP  agreements with among others, Wanadoo and PIPEX.  We have also signed afﬁ liate deals in a number of other  countries in Africa and Asia, as well as Russia. Aside from  the commercial value of these deals, Z GROUP has  strengthened its brand through these high profile  relationships and further improved its awareness and  credibility to a wider international audience.

              " ' VPhase plc   Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 05 Chief Executive’s Review I am delighted to report that the Group has successfully delivered  its key objective of positioning its first product VX1 to be ready for  the next stage of commercialisation in 2009 and to place VX1 in  an Ofgem Demonstration Action programme. This programme  has been fully funded by SSE to a value of up to £240,000, and it  is anticipated that these trials of VX1 will demonstrate significant  carbon dioxide savings when used in UK domestic properties.  Additionally, the Group is starting a programme of commercial  partnerships to introduce VPhase initially to European and then to  other geographic markets. We have already entered into a  memorandum of understanding with British Gas to consider  routes to market for VPhase products in the UK and also into  North America through Direct Energy, one of America’s leading  integrated energy companies and another Centrica-owned  business. We have also initiated dialogue with consumer unit  manufacturers, social housing organisations and energy   efficiency companies. Furthermore, we have examined both technically and commercially  the potential to expand the VPhase technology platform to  additional products and markets. Whilst we are focussed on  delivering the VX1 product, we believe that further products can  be readily produced for delivery into a wider range of geographical  markets such as North America and dedicated to high-end  energy saving applications. We have filed another patent on the basis of development work  carried out that expands the potential footprint, and the protection,  for our Smart Voltage Management technology. The Group has made excellent progress in 2008, having  established an experienced in-house team and working with a  specialist provider for design for manufacture and initial volume  manufacturing services, culminating in the trade launch of the  Group’s first product VX1. The VX1 product was previewed at a trade launch at the Interbuild  Exhibition held in October 2008. Interest in the product and the  principles of Smart Voltage Management was strong from a  broad section of the building and property industry, and the  Group is currently recruiting additional sales resource to respond  to this demand. Our progress in 2008   has been substantial   and provides the  soundest of foundations  for commercial success   in 2009. We are excited about   the relationships we have  built with SSE and British  Gas and are extremely  confident about the  future of VPhase. VPhase announces Ofgem approval for trialing  of the VPhase VX1 product under the UK  Government’s Carbon Emissions Reduction  Target (CERT) scheme in partnership with  Scottish and Southern Energy. “We are looking forward to confirming the  energy and carbon saving capability of the  VPhase VX1 device and subsequently making  the product available to SSE customers.”  Paul Wilkins, Energy Efficiency Team Leader for SSE  VPhase plc signs a memorandum of  understanding with British Gas to distribute   the VPhase energy saving product – subject to  successful trials.  “This MoU is another step in British Gas   putting in place a range of low carbon energy  technologies and products for our residential,  business and public sector customers. These  technologies will become increasingly  important as UK consumers seek to become  more energy efficient.”  Gearoid Lane, Managing Director of British Gas New Energy, leading the  product trials on behalf of British Gas Services 12065 Vphase FRONT.indd   5 17/4/09   19:38:53 VPhase plc   Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 06 We achieved or exceeded  our goals in 2008 and I  look forward to repeating  this success in 2009.

This share placing has enabled the Group  to accelerate the time and access to routes to market, and to  investigate other potential opportunities for Smart Voltage  Management, such as further domestic and small commercial  applications and other geographic regions. The Group has teamed with the two biggest utility companies in  the UK who jointly supply energy to around 40% of UK  households.  The Group continues to exercise strong cash management and  ends the year with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet  and a well defined route forward to commercialisation, with a  view to delivering growth and shareholder value. Key priorities for 2009 include the CE marking of VX1; the  expansion of our capacity to supply; capitalising on market  opportunities to generate revenue; and the development of further  products utilising our Smart Voltage Management technology. Overall, we expect 2009 to be another year of progress and  growth for VPhase plc and I look forward to updating you on our  progress at the time of our interims.

Vision: Our vision is clear: We will develop long term relationships with  •\\t key partners and customers to drive consumer  demand. We will continuously innovate in the design, •\\t manufacture and supply of products to satisfy  changing customer needs and seek to expand  our portfolio of products from both internal and  external sources. We will achieve this through committed  •\\t people operating in an open and stimulating  environment. Values: Efficiency  We will promote energy efficiency   in our markets and efficiency in   our own operations. Innovation   We are committed to innovation in   our products, processes, service  and support. Partnership  We will work closely with strategic  partners to support our key  competences, and with our  employees to drive our business  forward. “Working with our  strategic partners and  our employees we will  drive the business  forward.” Operating Review 2010 Since my appointment as Chief Executive Officer in September  2010 I have made sure that both the strategic objectives and the  short term targets for the business are clearly understood, both  internally and by our shareholders, as we set out at the time of our  interim results in September 2010. Six Months of Progress In December 2010, we announced our first Framework Agreement  with Eaga, part of EAGA plc, and this has already resulted in a  further supply agreement via Eaga with Everest Limited who now  offer VPhase with every solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) or energy efficient  boiler they sell. The Eaga agreement enables us to offer national  fulfilment within our advertising and marketing campaigns, directed  at both retailers and domestic customers. The Group has completed or has ongoing trials with 27 different  social housing groups and local authorities. This will be an area of  considerable focus for the Group over the forthcoming period and  a significant number of enquiries are currently being progressed. CERT Accreditation CERT (Carbon Emission Reduction Target) is seen as a key enabler  to accelerate the adoption of our technology. Over the last six months, an increased effort has been placed on  securing CERT credits. The field trial results, as independently analysed  by EA Technology, were submitted to Ofgem in October 2010, their  peer review by AEA Technology was completed by December 2010  and our response to that review submitted by the end of 2010.  On 21 March 2011 Ofgem confirmed that VPhase has secured a  CERT measure based around its initial Demonstration Action with  Scottish and Southern Energy (“SSE”) and Ofgem; at 2.5 tonnes of  carbon dioxide over a 20 year measure. The savings represent an  excellent, proven approach to lowering household carbon  emissions, yet the figure falls somewhat short of anticipated results,  given that the device has been independently rated for a 36 year  component lifespan. Other trials, for example Great Places and  staff homes, have demonstrated carbon dioxide savings to be  around 3.6 tonnes over a notional 20 year life. The CERT  Demonstration Action that was conducted in association with SSE  has indicated energy savings of 5.2 % (6.3% for a gas centrally  heated home). Whilst this is an important energy saving figure, the  ',\n",
              " ' JOiNT CHiEf EXECUTivES’ ST aTEmENT iNTrOdUCTiON The past financial year has seen  focus on the following areas: The core consumer product  ONSPEED, improving the cost  of acquisition and focusing on  customer retention, mitigating a  reduction in sales as a result of the  increasing use of Broadband; ONSPEED Mobile which  provides a fast, full Internet expe- rience on a mobile phone, was  launched last March 2006 and  the business continues to focus  on sales both to consumers and  also to operators;  The development of the innova- tive file sharing service OnShare,  and its underlying technology.  Beta testing of OnShare was  concluded in February 2007 and  is demonstrating encouraging  signs of success; Laying the groundwork for the  release of new products; and Towards the end of the year,  the commencement of a cost- cutting exercise. Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë fiNaNCiaL OvErviEw The Group’s results for the 12 months  ending 28 February 2007 show a  loss before tax of £1.1 million on  turnover of £2.6 million, compared  to a restated profit in 2006 of £0.4  million on turnover of £5.0 million. Turnover from ONSPEED re- presents 88% of total turnover  for the year. The fall in ONSPEED  turnover from £4.4 million for 2006  to £2.4 million in 2007 was princi- pally as a result of the growth of  competitive, fast Broadband in the  UK, Europe and the US.  Net2Roam contributed £0.1 million  to turnover (2006: £0.4 million)  and ONSPEED Mobile which was  launched in 2006 added £0.1 million  to turnover.  The loss in the year adjusted for all   non-cash items was £0.6 million.  Together with the investment  in OnShare of £1.3 million,  this has resulted in a net cash  outflow of £1.9 million, leaving  cash resources of £2.2 million at   28 February 2007. A cost saving plan was implemented  in January 2007 and we are already  seeing the benefits in the current  financial year. SHar E iSSUES 333,172 shares were issued in the  year on the exercise of share options  by three option holders. A further 3,942,134 shares were  issued to the minority shareholders  of Onshare Limited to acquire the  49% minority interest in the business,  ensuring that the benefits of the future  success of this service will flow 100%  to Z GROUP shareholders. rE viEw Of Op Era TiONS The primary aims in the past year were  to maintain good customer retention  in ONSPEED, while gaining market  traction for two new products,  ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare.  ONSpEEd In spite of the predicted decline in  Dial-up Internet access, ONSPEED  has performed well throughout the  year in retaining its direct customer  base whilst gaining additional rest of  the world revenue through partner- ships in new territories. Online sales  continue to account for the majority  of sales both in the UK and abroad.  ONSPEED has been a mainstay since the business was  founded and has provided a valuable Internet service  for those consumers who have not converted to Internet  Broadband usage. “safe” “(OnShare is) a safe and convenient   way of sharing files among friends” Web User Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 We recognise the need for   local support within international  markets and have established   relationships with key local  partners, which we have found to  be highly beneficial in supporting  sales growth. Following the  success of ONSPEED sales via  the web and the release of the  retail version in Europe, we have  signed a number of additional  distribution deals for ONSPEED  in Poland and Russia. In Russia,  we deployed a retail promotion  in March 2006 through monthly  scratch cards, thereby addressing  low credit card penetration   and successfully attracting   direct consumer revenue. In August  2006, we closed an agreement with  Voxnet, one of Poland’s leading  ISPs, to promote ONSPEED and  ONSPEED Mobile.  The Group’s retail presence in  Europe and the US has also been  strengthened. In April 2006, the  Group signed a retail agreement  with Avanquest, a leading global  publisher of best-selling personal  and professional software  marketed in over 100 countries,  for France and Spain gaining a  retail presence in key multiples  including FNAC, Boulanger and  through select online portals  such as Bluesquad and Blitzbox.  In February 2007, we appointed  Navarre (NASDAQ: NAVR), a  leading distributor of home enter- tainment PC software in the US.  In June 2006, we announced an  extension to the agreement with  BT to distribute ONSPEED to BT’s  512kb Broadband base, giving  these customers up to 5 times  faster connectivity with ONSPEED  Version 5. The Group continues to  use these high profile relationships  to further improve its awareness  and credibility to a wider interna- tional audience.  Marketing spend on ONSPEED  represented 29% of total Group  indirect costs, representing a  continuation of the historically  efficient use of marketing. With  targeted media buying and  innovative in-house analysis, cost  per sale equated to an efficient  £6.76 compared to £8.04 in 2006.  To further increase ARPU across  the ONSPEED base, we launched  an ONSPEED toolbar in February  2007, providing more value to the  ONSPEED product as well as a  search box powered by YAHOO! to  capitalise on search revenue from  the ONSPEED base. The benefit  of this added capability will be  reflected in next year’s results.  ONSPEED Mobile The ONSPEED Mobile product  became commercially available   in March 2006 via Internet  subscription and through existing  UK distribution channels, including  Amazon, PC World, Play and  Staples. ONSPEED Mobile has  received wide acclaim in the trade  press, many of whom believe that  demand will be triggered by the  current expense of accessing the  Internet via mobile devices – the  same driver behind the original   success of ONSPEED.  07 Ë “ONSPEED Mobile has  received wide acclaim  in the trade press” Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 JOiNT CHiEf EXECUTivES’ ST aTEmENT Fifteen publications have  presented upbeat reviews,  some granting 5 star awards,  notably Computer Active, Stuff  and WebUser. Although direct  consumer sales have been slow  to materialise, the Directors  believe in the size and strength  of the mobile Internet market  and feel ONSPEED Mobile is  well-positioned to benefit from  longer term consumer take-up. In  addition, deeper market penetra- tion will take place via partnership  with mobile network operators  as demonstrated by a diverse  pipeline of potential partners and  jurisdictions. OnShare The Group has continued to  invest significantly in OnShare,  the proprietary file sharing  software. The development of  OnShare over the last 12 months  has seen a series of continuous  improvements to the design  and functionality of the OnShare  product, with focus on building  stability and ease of use. In  addition, significant R&D has been  invested in OnShare’s underlying  protocol, “ActiveStream”. This  proprietary IP will be re-used and  is set to become the basis for  future consumer and corporate  product development.  OnShare was launched to a test  group of users in March 2006, with  subsequent upgrades through the  year. This test identified a number  of required improvements prior  to launch and in February 2007  a soft launch was implemented  providing users with free access  to the product which included a  mechanism to encourage viral  marketing. The growth in users  has exceeded budget and based  on this trend, we plan to commer- cialise the product with marketing  support around the middle of  the current financial year. Share- holders will be informed at the  commencement of this initiative  and will be regularly updated as   to progress. Net2Roam Net2Roam continues to provide  a consistent revenue stream,  with very little requirement for  additional resources or marketing  budget. Relaunched in February  2007 using iPass (NASDAQ: IPAS)  infrastructure, Net2Roam added  76,000 Wi-Fi hotspots in 68  countries to its offering. COST SaviNgS aNd  pErfOrmaNCE iN THE  CUrrENT fiNaNCiaL yEar A cost saving plan was imple- mented starting in January 2007,  based on a staff redundancy  programme, continuing focus  on efficient marketing spend,  streamlining server use across  our portfolio of products and  negotiating better terms with   our suppliers.  As a result of these costs   savings, our unaudited manage- ment accounts for the first two  months of the current financial   year show a 30% reduction in  administrative costs year-on-year.  In addition, consolidated sales  for quarter one of the current year  are ahead of budget. OUTLOOk The extended test launch of  OnShare, although putting us  behind our original plan at the  time of admission to AIM, has  resulted in a stronger offering to  consumers. OnShare offers several  unique features to consumers and  to SMEs which the Group intends  to take full advantage of in the   “great” “(ONSPEED Mobile is) a great way to bring  the web to your mobile phone, it works  extremely well”  Personal Computer World,   Product Of The Week Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 coming months. Additionally,  the R&D invested in OnShare’s  underlying proprietary protocol,  “ActiveStream” is well-placed  to be used in other products  developed by the Group to drive  future revenue streams.  Mobile Internet usage is the  key driver to ONSPEED Mobile,  our other recent product, which  uses proprietary compression  technology to enable more  efficient access to the Internet,   and we are confident of the  conclusion of operator agreements  and healthy consumer demand in   the coming year.

We aim to do  this with our cost effective products designed  to meet the growing global demand for  domestic and light commercial energy  efficiency technologies. Our Strategy To pursue identified market opportunities in the •\\t Group’s target sector of energy efficiency for  domestic and light commercial applications To produce products based on robust •\\t engineering principles, regularly utilising existing  mass produced components configured in a  novel and patentable way To avoid cutting edge science enabling us to •\\t de-risk the new product development process To provide exceptional levels of customer •\\t service To generate an environment which attracts •\\t highly skilled and motivated people that can  provide the Group with a sustainable  competitive advantage To manage the Group in a controlled •\\t governance environment with due regard   to financial and other business risks “Our 2009 target of  creating a platform for  revenue generation and  growth has been  achieved” I am pleased to present this review of progress over the last twelve  months and I am confident that we are now in a position to drive  forward the Group’s continuing commercial growth. We are  particularly pleased to see VPhase products being shipped to our  customers as they save both energy and money by optimising the  voltage supplied to their homes. Whilst VPhase has achieved initial sales, we do recognise that   it has taken longer than originally anticipated to have products  available commercially due to the delay in achieving CE marking.  Now that VPhase is a certified product, we are putting in place the  necessary measures to capitalise on the order pipeline that we’ve  built over the past two years. To deliver on our sales targets we  have established the associated supply chain and sales channels,  and have increased our marketing activities. The strict management of our cost base and cash resources has  allowed us to deliver an operating loss that, whilst higher than last  year by £0.14 million due to the increased commercial activity, is still  significantly lower than the Board’s expectations. We end the year  with £1.7 million cash in the bank, giving us comfort that our current  plans can be delivered from our existing resources.  General market review Continual concerns about the high costs of energy and the  tightening of budgets across homes and businesses in the downturn  have called for an ever greater need for cost-effective ways to  conserve energy and reduce household bills. In the   UK, our home ground and launch market, the government has also  recognised the need to support energy efficiency and conservation  in the household sector, which is responsible for roughly one- quarter of the country’s emissions. Indeed, the UK Government  announced a raft of initiatives in 2009 to promote carbon reduction  and smart energy management in the household sector.  A key development has been the proposal to extend CERT to 2012.  CERT obligates energy suppliers to deliver measures to limit carbon  emissions from UK homes. The current phase runs from 2008 to  2011 and covers carbon savings equivalent to the emissions from  700,000 homes per year. In early 2009 the government further  raised the CERT target by an additional 20%, and late in the year  proposed to extend the scheme to December 2012 with a higher  carbon reduction target.  7 VPhase plc Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 CESP was introduced which further requires energy suppliers and  generators to provide domestic energy efficiency measures via  community schemes, with a particular focus on serving households  in low-income areas.  The government rolled out a programme late last year to install  smart meters across all 26 million UK homes by 2020, as part   of a roadmap towards a more efficient energy system. We believe  that this will pave the way for the integration of smart energy  management technologies such as VPhase.  More recently, the government has announced plans for eco home  loans. These are designed to fund both the initial purchase of  energy-efficient technologies, such as our VPhase units, and also to  create an ongoing price differential between energy-efficient and  inefficient homes. Whilst government initiatives, in particular CERT, have been  instrumental in driving the adoption of energy-saving technologies  such as VPhase and in focusing public opinion on energy  conservation and carbon reduction, the Group’s position on   such initiatives is clear. Whether provided through eco-loans   or household efficiency programmes (such as CERT and smart  metering), they are useful in focusing public opinion on energy  conservation and carbon reduction. We prefer, however, to focus on  developing products that deliver a compelling economic case  without artificial subsidies from current or future governments and  to use such subsidies as an additional benefit for our customers.  Our VPhase product, by saving household bills while offering a  quick payback, offers a compelling proposition.  Operational Review The Group has put in place a wide range of new processes and  procedures to enable the consistent supply and delivery of quality  products to our customers. I would like to thank the teams who,  amongst other things, rapidly put in place the full range of procedures  and controls to enable the Group to start selling VPhase products,  not only to our commercial customers but also direct to the general  public through our website, www.vphase.com. The electronic sales  procedures entailed putting in place all procedures to comply with  the Distance Selling Regulations. The whole process was undertaken  over a very short period of time and has been operating successfully  for the past 6 months. The Group has been increasing the profile of VPhase and promoting  the VPhase message: “VPhase is the smart new way to cut your energy costs  immediately without changing your supplier or your lifestyle.   By reducing and managing the voltage coming into your home,  a VPhase device will ensure many of your electrical appliances  use less electricity and cost less to run. It will also lower your  carbon emissions. The device is simple to install by a qualified  electrician and requires no maintenance. It’s simply a matter  of fit, forget and save instantly!”  In the first half of 2009 VPhase completed the development of its  first domestic energy saving device. This achieved CE marking in  June, which means that the product complies with the essential  requirements of the relevant European health, safety and  environmental protection legislation and, therefore, permitting sales  across the UK and continental Europe. Initially sales have been  focused in the UK. Achieving the CE marking milestone also enabled Ofgem’s formal  Demonstration Action of the VPhase unit to commence, in  conjunction with Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), for the UK  government’s CERT scheme. The results from this trial will indicate  the level of lifetime carbon dioxide savings that utility companies  can claim through the CERT scheme from the sale of the VPhase  product. These trials are expected to conclude in the second  quarter of 2010, which is later than we anticipated due to delays   in the SSE customer selection and installation programme. These  trials are now fully installed. Trials are also being conducted with a major Northwest-based  social housing provider, British Gas, and in VPhase staff homes for  both product performance and marketing opportunities.  Independently analysed results from staff homes have shown  annualised savings of between £75 to £135 per home, dependent  upon the level of incoming voltage and load profile of the property.  These homes are all detached properties, and therefore smaller  homes are likely to have lower levels of savings. During the year we have increased our sales and marketing activities  and have promoted the VPhase device at: Ecobuild, the world’s  biggest trade and consumer event for sustainable design,  construction and the built environment; on the BBC’s Working  Lunch television programme; and in the national press. We recruited  a head of sales and have established training sessions with the  National Association of Professional Inspectors and Testers (NAPIT).  These training sessions allow VPhase to train electrical contractors  in the benefits and installation of VPhase whilst also introducing  them to the additional revenue opportunity that VPhase offers. We  have established a programme of these training sessions for 2010,  and are organising product familiarisation days with electrical  distributors for their customers along with a series of training days  for electricians at VPhase’s premises in Capenhurst. People We have delivered excellent performance with a team of eight  people. In 2010 we plan to expand this team with the further  recruitment of sales and marketing professionals.  Financial position and outlook We finished the year with cash levels ahead of the Directors’  expectations and a business well placed to capitalise on growing  sales and margins during 2010. Dr Lee Juby Chief Executive Officer 23 March 2010 “One quarter of the UK’s total  emissions come from homes, so  householders have to be a part of the  solution to climate change. Increasing  the energy efficiency of homes not  only helps reduce emissions, but will  also help reduce fuel bills” Ed Miliband, Energy and Climate Change Secretary, December 2009 ']"

This  success has been the result of consolidating our core  business, developing new delivery channels and expanding  into European and other international markets. We have  also made signiﬁ cant investment in our product portfolio,  both by licensing new technologies to commercialise  and by developing in-house proprietary technologies to  address the needs of mass consumer markets. AIMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Our primary aim this year was to increase our turnover  and profits whilst investing in the business to expand  our product portfolio. We are pleased to report that we  have achieved success in both endeavours. This growth  is a result of continued sales from ONSPEED and a sustained  revenue contribution from our other products.  By developing a number of new routes to market, through  both retail and afﬁ liate partnerships, as well as expanding our  customer base abroad, we have achieved signiﬁ cant sales  growth. In addition, we continue to maintain high customer  retention levels through the provision of unique and affordable  software services and excellent customer support. We have laid the foundations for the future this year through  sizeable investment in research and development. This  has resulted in the recent launch of ONSPEED Mobile and  the release of our revolutionary ﬁ le sharing software OnShare. Our ﬁ rst products Net2Roam and NetAway have provided  a consistent revenue stream, with very little requirement  for additional resources or marketing budget. It has been  through the success of these products that we have also  established strong relationships with distributors and retailers  that have been beneﬁ cial in the development of new routes  to market for ONSPEED both in the UK and abroad. Onbidder was also launched this year, and although  it only accounts for a small percentage of our revenue,  it also sells both online and through retail outlets, further  strengthening the Group’s brand position with major  retailers and consumers alike. ONSPEED has continued to perform very well throughout  the year and we now have over half a million customers.  Online sales have grown, continuing to account for the majority  of sales both in the UK and abroad. Ofﬂ ine sales increased  with the publication of a retail version of ONSPEED, which  is now sold in most major retailers in the UK and Europe.

              " ' VPhase plc  Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 05 Chief Executive’s Review I am delighted to report that the Group has successfully delivered its key objective of positioning its first product VX1 to be ready for the next stage of commercialisation in 2009 and to place VX1 in an Ofgem Demonstration Action programme. This programme has been fully funded by SSE to a value of up to £240,000, and it is anticipated that these trials of VX1 will demonstrate significant carbon dioxide savings when used in UK domestic properties. Additionally, the Group is starting a programme of commercial partnerships to introduce VPhase initially to European and then to other geographic markets. We have already entered into a memorandum of understanding with British Gas to consider routes to market for VPhase products in the UK and also into North America through Direct Energy, one of America’s leading integrated energy companies and another Centrica-owned business. We have also initiated dialogue with consumer unit manufacturers, social housing organisations and energy  efficiency companies. Furthermore, we have examined both technically and commercially the potential to expand the VPhase technology platform to additional products and markets. Whilst we are focussed on delivering the VX1 product, we believe that further products can be readily produced for delivery into a wider range of geographical markets such as North America and dedicated to high-end energy saving applications. We have filed another patent on the basis of development work carried out that expands the potential footprint, and the protection, for our Smart Voltage Management technology. The Group has made excellent progress in 2008, having established an experienced in-house team and working with a specialist provider for design for manufacture and initial volume manufacturing services, culminating in the trade launch of the Group’s first product VX1. The VX1 product was previewed at a trade launch at the Interbuild Exhibition held in October 2008. Interest in the product and the principles of Smart Voltage Management was strong from a broad section of the building and property industry, and the Group is currently recruiting additional sales resource to respond to this demand. Our progress in 2008  has been substantial  and provides the soundest of foundations for commercial success  in 2009. We are excited about  the relationships we have built with SSE and British Gas and are extremely confident about the future of VPhase. VPhase announces Ofgem approval for trialing of the VPhase VX1 product under the UK Government’s Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) scheme in partnership with Scottish and Southern Energy. “We are looking forward to confirming the energy and carbon saving capability of the VPhase VX1 device and subsequently making the product available to SSE customers.” Paul Wilkins, Energy Efficiency Team Leader for SSE VPhase plc signs a memorandum of understanding with British Gas to distribute  the VPhase energy saving product – subject to successful trials. “This MoU is another step in British Gas  putting in place a range of low carbon energy technologies and products for our residential, business and public sector customers. These technologies will become increasingly important as UK consumers seek to become more energy efficient.” Gearoid Lane, Managing Director of British Gas New Energy, leading the product trials on behalf of British Gas Services 12065 Vphase FRONT.indd  5 17/4/09  19:38:53 VPhase plc  Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 06 We achieved or exceeded our goals in 2008 and I look forward to repeating this success in 2009.

In May 2008, the Group raised £3.5 million (gross) by way of a placing of 70 million ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each, comprising 10.1% of the enlarged issued share capital, at a price of 5 pence per share. This share placing has enabled the Group to accelerate the time and access to routes to market, and to investigate other potential opportunities for Smart Voltage Management, such as further domestic and small commercial applications and other geographic regions. The Group has teamed with the two biggest utility companies in the UK who jointly supply energy to around 40% of UK households. The Group continues to exercise strong cash management and ends the year with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet and a well defined route forward to commercialisation, with a view to delivering growth and shareholder value. Key priorities for 2009 include the CE marking of VX1; the expansion of our capacity to supply; capitalising on market opportunities to generate revenue; and the development of further products utilising our Smart Voltage Management technology. Overall, we expect 2009 to be another year of progress and growth for VPhase plc and I look forward to updating you on our progress at the time of our interims.

Vision: Our vision is clear: We will develop long term relationships with • key partners and customers to drive consumer demand. We will continuously innovate in the design, • manufacture and supply of products to satisfy changing customer needs and seek to expand our portfolio of products from both internal and external sources. We will achieve this through committed • people operating in an open and stimulating environment. Values: Efficiency We will promote energy efficiency  in our markets and efficiency in  our own operations. Innovation  We are committed to innovation in  our products, processes, service and support. Partnership We will work closely with strategic partners to support our key competences, and with our employees to drive our business forward. “Working with our strategic partners and our employees we will drive the business forward.” Operating Review 2010 Since my appointment as Chief Executive Officer in September 2010 I have made sure that both the strategic objectives and the short term targets for the business are clearly understood, both internally and by our shareholders, as we set out at the time of our interim results in September 2010. Six Months of Progress In December 2010, we announced our first Framework Agreement with Eaga, part of EAGA plc, and this has already resulted in a further supply agreement via Eaga with Everest Limited who now offer VPhase with every solar Photovoltaic (“PV”) or energy efficient boiler they sell. The Eaga agreement enables us to offer national fulfilment within our advertising and marketing campaigns, directed at both retailers and domestic customers. The Group has completed or has ongoing trials with 27 different social housing groups and local authorities. This will be an area of considerable focus for the Group over the forthcoming period and a significant number of enquiries are currently being progressed. CERT Accreditation CERT (Carbon Emission Reduction Target) is seen as a key enabler to accelerate the adoption of our technology. Over the last six months, an increased effort has been placed on securing CERT credits. The field trial results, as independently analysed by EA Technology, were submitted to Ofgem in October 2010, their peer review by AEA Technology was completed by December 2010 and our response to that review submitted by the end of 2010. On 21 March 2011 Ofgem confirmed that VPhase has secured a CERT measure based around its initial Demonstration Action with Scottish and Southern Energy (“SSE”) and Ofgem; at 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide over a 20 year measure. The savings represent an excellent, proven approach to lowering household carbon emissions, yet the figure falls somewhat short of anticipated results, given that the device has been independently rated for a 36 year component lifespan. Other trials, for example Great Places and staff homes, have demonstrated carbon dioxide savings to be around 3.6 tonnes over a notional 20 year life. The CERT Demonstration Action that was conducted in association with SSE has indicated energy savings of 5.2 % (6.3% for a gas centrally heated home). Whilst this is an important energy saving figure, the ',\n",
              " ' JOiNT CHiEf EXECUTivES’ ST aTEmENT iNTrOdUCTiON The past financial year has seen focus on the following areas: The core consumer product ONSPEED, improving the cost of acquisition and focusing on customer retention, mitigating a reduction in sales as a result of the increasing use of Broadband; ONSPEED Mobile which provides a fast, full Internet expe- rience on a mobile phone, was launched last March 2006 and the business continues to focus on sales both to consumers and also to operators; The development of the innova- tive file sharing service OnShare, and its underlying technology. Beta testing of OnShare was concluded in February 2007 and is demonstrating encouraging signs of success; Laying the groundwork for the release of new products; and Towards the end of the year, the commencement of a cost- cutting exercise. Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë fiNaNCiaL OvErviEw The Group’s results for the 12 months ending 28 February 2007 show a loss before tax of £1.1 million on turnover of £2.6 million, compared to a restated profit in 2006 of £0.4 million on turnover of £5.0 million. Turnover from ONSPEED re- presents 88% of total turnover for the year. The fall in ONSPEED turnover from £4.4 million for 2006 to £2.4 million in 2007 was princi- pally as a result of the growth of competitive, fast Broadband in the UK, Europe and the US. Net2Roam contributed £0.1 million to turnover (2006: £0.4 million) and ONSPEED Mobile which was launched in 2006 added £0.1 million to turnover. The loss in the year adjusted for all  non-cash items was £0.6 million. Together with the investment in OnShare of £1.3 million, this has resulted in a net cash outflow of £1.9 million, leaving cash resources of £2.2 million at  28 February 2007. A cost saving plan was implemented in January 2007 and we are already seeing the benefits in the current financial year. SHar E iSSUES 333,172 shares were issued in the year on the exercise of share options by three option holders. A further 3,942,134 shares were issued to the minority shareholders of Onshare Limited to acquire the 49% minority interest in the business, ensuring that the benefits of the future success of this service will flow 100% to Z GROUP shareholders. rE viEw Of Op Era TiONS The primary aims in the past year were to maintain good customer retention in ONSPEED, while gaining market traction for two new products, ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare. ONSpEEd In spite of the predicted decline in Dial-up Internet access, ONSPEED has performed well throughout the year in retaining its direct customer base whilst gaining additional rest of the world revenue through partner- ships in new territories. Online sales continue to account for the majority of sales both in the UK and abroad. ONSPEED has been a mainstay since the business was founded and has provided a valuable Internet service for those consumers who have not converted to Internet Broadband usage. “safe” “(OnShare is) a safe and convenient  way of sharing files among friends” Web User Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 We recognise the need for  local support within international markets and have established  relationships with key local partners, which we have found to be highly beneficial in supporting sales growth. Following the success of ONSPEED sales via the web and the release of the retail version in Europe, we have signed a number of additional distribution deals for ONSPEED in Poland and Russia. In Russia, we deployed a retail promotion in March 2006 through monthly scratch cards, thereby addressing low credit card penetration  and successfully attracting  direct consumer revenue. In August 2006, we closed an agreement with Voxnet, one of Poland’s leading ISPs, to promote ONSPEED and ONSPEED Mobile. The Group’s retail presence in Europe and the US has also been strengthened. In April 2006, the Group signed a retail agreement with Avanquest, a leading global publisher of best-selling personal and professional software marketed in over 100 countries, for France and Spain gaining a retail presence in key multiples including FNAC, Boulanger and through select online portals such as Bluesquad and Blitzbox. In February 2007, we appointed Navarre (NASDAQ: NAVR), a leading distributor of home enter- tainment PC software in the US. In June 2006, we announced an extension to the agreement with BT to distribute ONSPEED to BT’s 512kb Broadband base, giving these customers up to 5 times faster connectivity with ONSPEED Version 5. The Group continues to use these high profile relationships to further improve its awareness and credibility to a wider interna- tional audience. Marketing spend on ONSPEED represented 29% of total Group indirect costs, representing a continuation of the historically efficient use of marketing. With targeted media buying and innovative in-house analysis, cost per sale equated to an efficient £6.76 compared to £8.04 in 2006. To further increase ARPU across the ONSPEED base, we launched an ONSPEED toolbar in February 2007, providing more value to the ONSPEED product as well as a search box powered by YAHOO! to capitalise on search revenue from the ONSPEED base. The benefit of this added capability will be reflected in next year’s results. ONSPEED Mobile The ONSPEED Mobile product became commercially available  in March 2006 via Internet subscription and through existing UK distribution channels, including Amazon, PC World, Play and Staples. ONSPEED Mobile has received wide acclaim in the trade press, many of whom believe that demand will be triggered by the current expense of accessing the Internet via mobile devices – the same driver behind the original  success of ONSPEED. 07 Ë “ONSPEED Mobile has received wide acclaim in the trade press” Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 JOiNT CHiEf EXECUTivES’ ST aTEmENT Fifteen publications have presented upbeat reviews, some granting 5 star awards, notably Computer Active, Stuff and WebUser. Although direct consumer sales have been slow to materialise, the Directors believe in the size and strength of the mobile Internet market and feel ONSPEED Mobile is well-positioned to benefit from longer term consumer take-up. In addition, deeper market penetra- tion will take place via partnership with mobile network operators as demonstrated by a diverse pipeline of potential partners and jurisdictions. OnShare The Group has continued to invest significantly in OnShare, the proprietary file sharing software. The development of OnShare over the last 12 months has seen a series of continuous improvements to the design and functionality of the OnShare product, with focus on building stability and ease of use. In addition, significant R&D has been invested in OnShare’s underlying protocol, “ActiveStream”. This proprietary IP will be re-used and is set to become the basis for future consumer and corporate product development. OnShare was launched to a test group of users in March 2006, with subsequent upgrades through the year. This test identified a number of required improvements prior to launch and in February 2007 a soft launch was implemented providing users with free access to the product which included a mechanism to encourage viral marketing. The growth in users has exceeded budget and based on this trend, we plan to commer- cialise the product with marketing support around the middle of the current financial year. Share- holders will be informed at the commencement of this initiative and will be regularly updated as  to progress. Net2Roam Net2Roam continues to provide a consistent revenue stream, with very little requirement for additional resources or marketing budget. Relaunched in February 2007 using iPass (NASDAQ: IPAS) infrastructure, Net2Roam added 76,000 Wi-Fi hotspots in 68 countries to its offering. COST SaviNgS aNd pErfOrmaNCE iN THE CUrrENT fiNaNCiaL yEar A cost saving plan was imple- mented starting in January 2007, based on a staff redundancy programme, continuing focus on efficient marketing spend, streamlining server use across our portfolio of products and negotiating better terms with  our suppliers. As a result of these costs  savings, our unaudited manage- ment accounts for the first two months of the current financial  year show a 30% reduction in administrative costs year-on-year. In addition, consolidated sales for quarter one of the current year are ahead of budget. OUTLOOk The extended test launch of OnShare, although putting us behind our original plan at the time of admission to AIM, has resulted in a stronger offering to consumers. OnShare offers several unique features to consumers and to SMEs which the Group intends to take full advantage of in the  “great” “(ONSPEED Mobile is) a great way to bring the web to your mobile phone, it works extremely well” Personal Computer World,  Product Of The Week Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 coming months. Additionally, the R&D invested in OnShare’s underlying proprietary protocol, “ActiveStream” is well-placed to be used in other products developed by the Group to drive future revenue streams. Mobile Internet usage is the key driver to ONSPEED Mobile, our other recent product, which uses proprietary compression technology to enable more efficient access to the Internet,  and we are confident of the conclusion of operator agreements and healthy consumer demand in  the coming year. The Group has continued to identify commercial opportuni- ties for new technologies and to develop products that satisfy consumer needs. We have a confirmed launch plan for two new and exciting software products that adhere to our high margin, pre-paid criteria. The sentiment within the Group is one of excitement for the current financial year, with a focus on maintaining our core businesses, exploiting the Group’s IP and developing a new pipeline of products with a more efficient cost-base.

              " ' 6 VPhase plc Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 Chief Executive’s Review Dr Lee Juby Chief Executive Officer  Our Objective To provide long term shareholder value through • the commercial growth of our business leading to growing earnings per share. We aim to do this with our cost effective products designed to meet the growing global demand for domestic and light commercial energy efficiency technologies. Our Strategy To pursue identified market opportunities in the • Group’s target sector of energy efficiency for domestic and light commercial applications To produce products based on robust • engineering principles, regularly utilising existing mass produced components configured in a novel and patentable way To avoid cutting edge science enabling us to • de-risk the new product development process To provide exceptional levels of customer • service To generate an environment which attracts • highly skilled and motivated people that can provide the Group with a sustainable competitive advantage To manage the Group in a controlled • governance environment with due regard  to financial and other business risks “Our 2009 target of creating a platform for revenue generation and growth has been achieved” I am pleased to present this review of progress over the last twelve months and I am confident that we are now in a position to drive forward the Group’s continuing commercial growth. We are particularly pleased to see VPhase products being shipped to our customers as they save both energy and money by optimising the voltage supplied to their homes. Whilst VPhase has achieved initial sales, we do recognise that  it has taken longer than originally anticipated to have products available commercially due to the delay in achieving CE marking. Now that VPhase is a certified product, we are putting in place the necessary measures to capitalise on the order pipeline that we’ve built over the past two years. To deliver on our sales targets we have established the associated supply chain and sales channels, and have increased our marketing activities. The strict management of our cost base and cash resources has allowed us to deliver an operating loss that, whilst higher than last year by £0.14 million due to the increased commercial activity, is still significantly lower than the Board’s expectations. We end the year with £1.7 million cash in the bank, giving us comfort that our current plans can be delivered from our existing resources. General market review Continual concerns about the high costs of energy and the tightening of budgets across homes and businesses in the downturn have called for an ever greater need for cost-effective ways to conserve energy and reduce household bills. In the  UK, our home ground and launch market, the government has also recognised the need to support energy efficiency and conservation in the household sector, which is responsible for roughly one- quarter of the country’s emissions. Indeed, the UK Government announced a raft of initiatives in 2009 to promote carbon reduction and smart energy management in the household sector. A key development has been the proposal to extend CERT to 2012. CERT obligates energy suppliers to deliver measures to limit carbon emissions from UK homes. The current phase runs from 2008 to 2011 and covers carbon savings equivalent to the emissions from 700,000 homes per year. In early 2009 the government further raised the CERT target by an additional 20%, and late in the year proposed to extend the scheme to December 2012 with a higher carbon reduction target. 7 VPhase plc Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 CESP was introduced which further requires energy suppliers and generators to provide domestic energy efficiency measures via community schemes, with a particular focus on serving households in low-income areas. The government rolled out a programme late last year to install smart meters across all 26 million UK homes by 2020, as part  of a roadmap towards a more efficient energy system. We believe that this will pave the way for the integration of smart energy management technologies such as VPhase. More recently, the government has announced plans for eco home loans. These are designed to fund both the initial purchase of energy-efficient technologies, such as our VPhase units, and also to create an ongoing price differential between energy-efficient and inefficient homes. Whilst government initiatives, in particular CERT, have been instrumental in driving the adoption of energy-saving technologies such as VPhase and in focusing public opinion on energy conservation and carbon reduction, the Group’s position on  such initiatives is clear. Whether provided through eco-loans  or household efficiency programmes (such as CERT and smart metering), they are useful in focusing public opinion on energy conservation and carbon reduction. We prefer, however, to focus on developing products that deliver a compelling economic case without artificial subsidies from current or future governments and to use such subsidies as an additional benefit for our customers. Our VPhase product, by saving household bills while offering a quick payback, offers a compelling proposition. Operational Review The Group has put in place a wide range of new processes and procedures to enable the consistent supply and delivery of quality products to our customers. I would like to thank the teams who, amongst other things, rapidly put in place the full range of procedures and controls to enable the Group to start selling VPhase products, not only to our commercial customers but also direct to the general public through our website, www.vphase.com. The electronic sales procedures entailed putting in place all procedures to comply with the Distance Selling Regulations. The whole process was undertaken over a very short period of time and has been operating successfully for the past 6 months. The Group has been increasing the profile of VPhase and promoting the VPhase message: “VPhase is the smart new way to cut your energy costs immediately without changing your supplier or your lifestyle.  By reducing and managing the voltage coming into your home, a VPhase device will ensure many of your electrical appliances use less electricity and cost less to run. It will also lower your carbon emissions. The device is simple to install by a qualified electrician and requires no maintenance. It’s simply a matter of fit, forget and save instantly!” In the first half of 2009 VPhase completed the development of its first domestic energy saving device. This achieved CE marking in June, which means that the product complies with the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation and, therefore, permitting sales across the UK and continental Europe. Initially sales have been focused in the UK. Achieving the CE marking milestone also enabled Ofgem’s formal Demonstration Action of the VPhase unit to commence, in conjunction with Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), for the UK government’s CERT scheme. The results from this trial will indicate the level of lifetime carbon dioxide savings that utility companies can claim through the CERT scheme from the sale of the VPhase product. These trials are expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2010, which is later than we anticipated due to delays  in the SSE customer selection and installation programme. These trials are now fully installed. Trials are also being conducted with a major Northwest-based social housing provider, British Gas, and in VPhase staff homes for both product performance and marketing opportunities. Independently analysed results from staff homes have shown annualised savings of between £75 to £135 per home, dependent upon the level of incoming voltage and load profile of the property. These homes are all detached properties, and therefore smaller homes are likely to have lower levels of savings. During the year we have increased our sales and marketing activities and have promoted the VPhase device at: Ecobuild, the world’s biggest trade and consumer event for sustainable design, construction and the built environment; on the BBC’s Working Lunch television programme; and in the national press. We recruited a head of sales and have established training sessions with the National Association of Professional Inspectors and Testers (NAPIT). These training sessions allow VPhase to train electrical contractors in the benefits and installation of VPhase whilst also introducing them to the additional revenue opportunity that VPhase offers. We have established a programme of these training sessions for 2010, and are organising product familiarisation days with electrical distributors for their customers along with a series of training days for electricians at VPhase’s premises in Capenhurst. People We have delivered excellent performance with a team of eight people. In 2010 we plan to expand this team with the further recruitment of sales and marketing professionals. Financial position and outlook We finished the year with cash levels ahead of the Directors’ expectations and a business well placed to capitalise on growing sales and margins during 2010. Dr Lee Juby Chief Executive Officer 23 March 2010 “One quarter of the UK’s total emissions come from homes, so householders have to be a part of the solution to climate change. Increasing the energy efficiency of homes not only helps reduce emissions, but will also help reduce fuel bills” Ed Miliband, Energy and Climate Change Secretary, December 2009 ']"
