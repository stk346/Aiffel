            " TOPPS TILES PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007 05 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT WE HAVE AGAIN THIS YEAR  DEMONSTRATED THE STRENGTH OF OUR STRATEGY AND OUR ORGANIC GROWTH. OUR MARKET LEADING POSITION, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COMMITTED STAFF HAVE ALL  CONTRIBUTED TO ANOTHER SOLID YEAR DESPITE A TOUGH HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET. Tile Clearing House (“TCH”) Tile Clearing House, our “cash and carry” offering has had a strong trading period. We have opened a net 9 new TCH outlets and the format continues to prove popular with both trade customers and jobbing builders. We now have a total of 55 stores in the UK. New locations include Dartford, Southend, Plymouth and Lincoln.  Holland Against the backdrop of a stable market, we have seen good growth in sales and profits in our Dutch business. We opened a further five stores taking the total to 20. Our marketing activity has been at a local level to date. However, as we experienced with the UK market, as we begin to reach a size that brings scalable benefits we anticipate increasing our advertising and marketing to a national audience. We continue to improve the mix of sales with 25% now coming from tiles and the remainder from wood flooring, accessories and adhesives. Plans for the current year include the opening of a minimum of a  further five new stores. UK Store Development and Expansion We are pleased to have again achieved our store opening target of 30 net new stores in the period, giving us an overall total of 301 trading outlets throughout the UK. We have modified the target going forward to a minimum of 20 net new stores reflecting a wider focus on improving and renewing the estate.   Topps Tiles We have opened 25 stores in new locations, rebranded 2 from the TCH format, refitted 10 outlets and closed or relocated a further 6 giving us a total of 246 Topps stores. New locations include Crewe, Sheffield, Gloucester, Aylesbury, Scarborough, Brixton and Byfleet. We continue to develop our store portfolio and have now rolled out our new format across a total of 65 stores. The new enhanced display formats are proving popular with both customers and staff. We introduced a number of new ranges with a particular focus on natural products due to their increasing popularity.  Our aim is simple – to deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders and  central to that aim are our customers. We strive to enhance our customers’ buying experience by constantly improving stores and ranges and offering the best in customer service. TOPPS TILES PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007 06 Marketing, advertising and sponsorship Over the last year we have maintained our national and regional marketing and advertising campaigns with Carlton Weather and our sponsorship of the UK Style channel. This year we also signed a sponsorship deal with Leicester City Football Club to coincide with the kick-off of the new football season in August. Although a commercial deal we very much see this as an extension to our community youth football initiative. Topps Tiles is Britain’s biggest supporter of community youth football and we currently sponsor around 300 local teams nationwide.  Staff development and customer service Recruiting and retaining ambitious people at Topps is a core part of our strategy. We place significant emphasis on the training and development of our employees. We have continued to develop our e-learning training system in store with a number of new courses.  CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT continued Group revenue was £207.9m, an increase of 15.4% on last year with like-for-like revenue for the period up 4.7%. Group operating profit was £44.3 million, an increase of 14.1%  compared with last year. We differentiate our business from the competition in a number of ways. All of our stores carry a wide range and supply of stock, we offer a loan-a-tile service, a free “How to” DVD, a tile cutting service and a buy-back service allowing customers to “sell back” undamaged tiles within 45 days of purchase. These services coupled with friendly and knowledgeable staff offering technical advice led to 97.6% of customers surveyed expressing levels of  satisfaction as ‘good to excellent’ (2006: 99.1%). Corporate responsibility Topps believes in conducting its business in a manner which achieves sustainable growth whilst incorporating and demonstrating social responsibility. Our policy is  published on our website at www.toppstiles.co.uk and more detail on our achievements can be found later in this report. The Board takes regular account of social, environmental and ethical matters in the business of the Group and believes in being responsible in the way that it conducts its operations.  TOPPS TILES PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007 07 a requirement for a broader product offering and also a trend towards refurbishing traditional rooms more  regularly. Alongside these consumer trends household numbers continue to grow faster than the UK population, which is anticipated to rise by 12% over the next 25 years (source: ONS). This is in contrast to the increasing number of households, which is expected to grow by almost 23% in the next 20 years, from 20.9m in 2003 to 25.7m in 2026, 3 million of these are expected to be built by 2020. (source: Government forecasts). We therefore believe Topps is well placed to benefit from these consumer and housing trends driving the growth in the tile market.  Current Trading and Outlook               In the first 7 weeks of the new financial period Group overall revenue increased by 8.4% and like for like sales by 1.1%. In the UK revenue increased 8.1% and like for like sales by 1.0%. In Holland overall sales increased 18.1% with like for like sales up 2.5%. We have had a challenging but positive start to the new financial period and there remains an underlying growth trend in the retail tile market. Whilst we believe the prospects for the future growth of Topps Tiles remain broadly positive we must not underestimate the potential impact that this year’s turmoil in financial markets will ultimately have on consumers.   Matthew Williams Chief Executive Officer Topps is pleased to be a constituent member of the FTSE4Good UK Index. The Market We are the leading tile retailer in the UK with an estimated market share of in excess of 22% and we have continued to grow market share over the last financial year. The Home Improvement retail sector continues to see overall expansion and the UK tile market is forecast to grow by volume by over 15% between 2007 and 2011 (source: MBD). There is significant potential for growth in our  marketplace with the UK still having one of the lowest usages per head of ceramic tiles in Europe, at a level around one third of that of other Northern European countries (source: MBD). Consumers are becoming more demanding and buying trends are showing the desire to tile rooms beyond the traditional kitchen and bathroom, 4.7% Like-for-like sales growth. 62.8% Overall Group gross margin (2006: 62.6%). \n"

              "\" TOPPS TILES PLC  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 07 This year, in a turbulent UK trading environment, we have again demonstrated the fundamental strength of our business through the continued delivery of improved profits. Store Development and Expansion                                                                      Our national store opening programme continues apace with a net 24 new stores (20 Topps and 4 Tile Clearing House) opened in this  financial year. We now have a total of 244 trading stores (207 Topps and 37 Tile Clearing House) and are firmly on our way to achieving our stated target of a minimum of 350 UK outlets. We continue to enjoy a good pipeline of suitable sites for occupation or development. In line with our policy of continued store development and  refurbishment, 3 stores were closed or relocated, 15 re-fitted and a net 24 new stores opened in the period. We have a total of 64 stores  offering our tile studio concept of extra choice of up-market tiles,  available on a special order basis and 17 floorstores with an enhanced stock range of laminate and real wood flooring. The average square footage of our stores has increased gradually and is now  over 6,300 square feet. Our Stoneworks concept has continued to be popular, as consumers’ appetite for natural product grows. We now have 19 stores open with a full Stoneworks offering and we also offer a selected range of these products in all our other stores. Holland We now have a total of 13 stores trading in Holland under our 50/50 joint venture including two new stores opened in the period. It is our intention to open a minimum two stores in the next financial period.     Marketing, advertising and sponsorship As part of our strategy to be “the brand” of choice in the UK we  have again continued our nationwide marketing and advertising  programme. Our approach is two fold: using national television  advertising both digital and terrestrial coupled with print and radio advertising on a regional basis. This is not only an effective strategy in respect of maximising our reach UK wide but is also a cost effective approach, spreading costs across each store in concentrated areas such as central London, for example, the Carlton Weather sponsorship.

At manufacturers selling prices the market was worth close to £400  million in 2004 (source MBD).   The UK still has a very low consumption rate compared to its European counterparts with only 1.1% of world consumption in 2004 compared with, for example Spain at 5.9% (Source: Ceramic World Review). Consumption continues to increase driven by issues such as health and hygiene, an increase in second bathrooms, shower rooms,  conservatories and utility rooms and an increase in the use of  underfloor heating systems.   UK Retail sales of ceramic tiles are expected to increase by 26% by 2010 (source: MBD) and we are confident therefore of the continued growth in the ceramic tile market. Current trading In the first seven weeks of the new financial period we have recorded a like-for-like sales decrease of 4.7%, however, the two year like-for-like sales shows an increase of 14.1%. Overall sales have increased by 1.2% over last year and 24.8% over two years.  We have opened stores in Hayes, Lewes and Pentonville Road already this new financial year with our target roll-out of 24 new stores for 2005/06. There is no doubt that we, along with the rest of the UK retail sector, are experiencing a very tough trading environment. However, given the strength of these results we believe we have the right business model and the best people to continue to gain market share and we are well placed to maintain our goal of providing sustainable returns for  shareholders. Nicholas Ounstead Chief Executive Officer CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT continued Topps Tiles is one of Britain's biggest supporters of youth  football. Topps stores currently sponsor 225 teams nationwide and our yellow kit is arguably the most famous in the beautiful game. Staff Development and Customer Service Our vision is of high-performing, motivated and well-trained people who can make a difference to our customers, shareholders, the  business and themselves. We live by our values of friendly, helpful and expert advice.   The quality of leadership in the company is key to the successful  delivery of our strategy for growth and our commitment to training, development and career progression is demonstrated through our  in-house training school, incentive schemes, bonus system, share save schemes and other incentives including the ‘Home Computing Initiative’ and the ‘Cycle to Work’ schemes. We have recently introduced a comprehensive employee benefits scheme which includes a whole range of internal and external company benefits from discounts on holidays to an employee helpline service. We understand the true value of all our employees and actively encourage the recruitment of staff from all age groups. We have a  policy of internal promotion, encouraging employees to advance their careers both in the stores and the Head Office functions. The market Despite a widely reported slow down in spending, we believe that in the mid-longer term DIY retail remains a relatively stable sector. There are a number of factors underpinning the future of the retail DIY  market. The UK population is growing steadily, particularly in the 35- 64 key age band for DIY; and household numbers are growing faster than the population up from 22.4 million in 1991 to 24.5 million in 2003; and owner occupancy is also on the rise and with an ageing UK housing stock that requires constant repair and maintenance.
