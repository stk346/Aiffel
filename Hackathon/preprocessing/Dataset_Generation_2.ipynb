This  success has been the result of consolidating our core  business, developing new delivery channels and expanding  into European and other international markets. We have  also made signiﬁ cant investment in our product portfolio,  both by licensing new technologies to commercialise  and by developing in-house proprietary technologies to  address the needs of mass consumer markets. AIMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Our primary aim this year was to increase our turnover  and profits whilst investing in the business to expand  our product portfolio. We are pleased to report that we  have achieved success in both endeavours. This growth  is a result of continued sales from ONSPEED and a sustained  revenue contribution from our other products.  By developing a number of new routes to market, through  both retail and afﬁ liate partnerships, as well as expanding our  customer base abroad, we have achieved signiﬁ cant sales  growth. In addition, we continue to maintain high customer  retention levels through the provision of unique and affordable  software services and excellent customer support. We have laid the foundations for the future this year through  sizeable investment in research and development. This  has resulted in the recent launch of ONSPEED Mobile and  the release of our revolutionary ﬁ le sharing software OnShare. Our ﬁ rst products Net2Roam and NetAway have provided  a consistent revenue stream, with very little requirement  for additional resources or marketing budget. It has been  through the success of these products that we have also  established strong relationships with distributors and retailers  that have been beneﬁ cial in the development of new routes  to market for ONSPEED both in the UK and abroad. Onbidder was also launched this year, and although  it only accounts for a small percentage of our revenue,  it also sells both online and through retail outlets, further  strengthening the Group’s brand position with major  retailers and consumers alike. ONSPEED has continued to perform very well throughout  the year and we now have over half a million customers.  Online sales have grown, continuing to account for the majority  of sales both in the UK and abroad. Ofﬂ ine sales increased  with the publication of a retail version of ONSPEED, which  is now sold in most major retailers in the UK and Europe.  The Group further developed its Internet acceleration software  for Dial-up and Broadband, with the release in January 2006   07 Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 “ By developing a number  of new routes to market,  through both retail and  afﬁ liate partnerships as  well as expanding our  customer base abroad  we have achieved  signiﬁ cant sales growth.

The addition of ONSPEED Version 5  has allowed us to market the product more effectively to  Broadband customers in addition to the existing Dial-up  customer base. NEW ROUTES TO MARKET Following the success of ONSPEED sales via the web and  the release of the retail version, we have signed a number  of distribution deals for ONSPEED this year. These include  Koch Media, one of Europe’s largest software distributors,  with which we have signed deals in the UK, Germany,  Switzerland, Austria and Italy. In the UK, our retail products  are available in the key software retailers such as PC World,  WH Smith, Game, HMV and Virgin. The product was  successfully chart-tracked in the retail market, a key driver  for establishing good credentials and positioning with  retailers. Signiﬁ cant sales were achieved through this channel,  which opened up the market for ONSPEED to a wider  audience. It has also served well in promoting the ONSPEED  brand to the consumer marketplace. In addition we have distribution deals in place with  companies in the USA, Russia, the rest of Europe, Africa  and Asia. We recognise the need for local support within  international markets and have established relationships  with key local partners, which we have found to be highly   “ When so many programs claim to speed up your net  connection it’s refreshing to ﬁ nd one that actually does it.” .Net magazine  08 Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 “ We are delighted by the  Group’s progress since  admission to AIM and  this is, in large part, due  to the skill and hard work  of our employees.” beneficial in supporting sales growth. The demand  for products such as ONSPEED is very high in these  countries, with the majority of Internet users still on  Dial-up connections. During the year, the Group has established itself within  the international retail sector and retail sales now account  for 18% of turnover. Our strong relationships with the  major retailers will stand us in good stead for future  product releases, including ONSPEED Mobile and  OnShare. Distribution deals are already lined up for the  retail version of ONSPEED Mobile as well as a number  of consumer-focused gaming software products. ONLINE AND AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIPS This year we formed a number of new afﬁ liate partnerships  and consolidated existing ones. Our deal with BT has  continued to drive sales and we have signed new ISP  agreements with among others, Wanadoo and PIPEX.  We have also signed afﬁ liate deals in a number of other  countries in Africa and Asia, as well as Russia. Aside from  the commercial value of these deals, Z GROUP has  strengthened its brand through these high profile  relationships and further improved its awareness and  credibility to a wider international audience.  JOINT CHIEF EXECUTIVES’ STATEMENT CONTINUED “ Speed up your modem Internet connection to Broadband  speeds. We’re serious! An amazing piece of software.” PC Answers magazine  09 AWARD-WINNING SOFTWARE Not only has it been an encouraging year for the Group  in terms of sales growth but we have also received  a number of awards from the technical press that have  helped establish ONSPEED as the recognised market  leader. This has raised our proﬁ le within the software  industry, distinguishing the Group as a highly innovative  provider of consumer-focused software services. OUTLOOK We are delighted by the Group’s progress since  admission to AIM and this is, in large part, due  to the skill and hard work of our employees.  By building on the success of our existing products,  we expect to see sustained levels of sales growth  in the period ahead. We also anticipate additional  growth will be achieved from our expanded product  portfolio and further development of our own IP and we  will continue to explore new opportunities for the Group  throughout the year. JACK BEKHOR Joint Chief Executive JAMIE TRUE Joint Chief Executive 30 May 2006 Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 “ We have also laid the foundations for the future this year,  through sizeable investment in research and development,  which has resulted in the launch of ONSPEED Mobile  and OnShare.” ',\n",
              " ' JOiNT CHiEf EXECUTivES’ ST aTEmENT iNTrOdUCTiON The past financial year has seen  focus on the following areas: The core consumer product  ONSPEED, improving the cost  of acquisition and focusing on  customer retention, mitigating a  reduction in sales as a result of the  increasing use of Broadband; ONSPEED Mobile which  provides a fast, full Internet expe- rience on a mobile phone, was  launched last March 2006 and  the business continues to focus  on sales both to consumers and  also to operators;  The development of the innova- tive file sharing service OnShare,  and its underlying technology.  Beta testing of OnShare was  concluded in February 2007 and  is demonstrating encouraging  signs of success; Laying the groundwork for the  release of new products; and Towards the end of the year,  the commencement of a cost- cutting exercise. Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë fiNaNCiaL OvErviEw The Group’s results for the 12 months  ending 28 February 2007 show a  loss before tax of £1.1 million on  turnover of £2.6 million, compared  to a restated profit in 2006 of £0.4  million on turnover of £5.0 million. Turnover from ONSPEED re- presents 88% of total turnover  for the year. The fall in ONSPEED  turnover from £4.4 million for 2006  to £2.4 million in 2007 was princi- pally as a result of the growth of  competitive, fast Broadband in the  UK, Europe and the US.  Net2Roam contributed £0.1 million  to turnover (2006: £0.4 million)  and ONSPEED Mobile which was  launched in 2006 added £0.1 million  to turnover.  The loss in the year adjusted for all   non-cash items was £0.6 million.  Together with the investment  in OnShare of £1.3 million,  this has resulted in a net cash  outflow of £1.9 million, leaving  cash resources of £2.2 million at   28 February 2007. A cost saving plan was implemented  in January 2007 and we are already  seeing the benefits in the current  financial year. SHar E iSSUES 333,172 shares were issued in the  year on the exercise of share options  by three option holders. A further 3,942,134 shares were  issued to the minority shareholders  of Onshare Limited to acquire the  49% minority interest in the business,  ensuring that the benefits of the future  success of this service will flow 100%  to Z GROUP shareholders. rE viEw Of Op Era TiONS The primary aims in the past year were  to maintain good customer retention  in ONSPEED, while gaining market  traction for two new products,  ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare.  ONSpEEd In spite of the predicted decline in  Dial-up Internet access, ONSPEED  has performed well throughout the  year in retaining its direct customer  base whilst gaining additional rest of  the world revenue through partner- ships in new territories. Online sales  continue to account for the majority  of sales both in the UK and abroad.  ONSPEED has been a mainstay since the business was  founded and has provided a valuable Internet service  for those consumers who have not converted to Internet  Broadband usage. “safe” “(OnShare is) a safe and convenient   way of sharing files among friends” Web User Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 We recognise the need for   local support within international  markets and have established   relationships with key local  partners, which we have found to  be highly beneficial in supporting  sales growth. Following the  success of ONSPEED sales via  the web and the release of the  retail version in Europe, we have  signed a number of additional  distribution deals for ONSPEED  in Poland and Russia. In Russia,  we deployed a retail promotion  in March 2006 through monthly  scratch cards, thereby addressing  low credit card penetration   and successfully attracting   direct consumer revenue. In August  2006, we closed an agreement with  Voxnet, one of Poland’s leading  ISPs, to promote ONSPEED and  ONSPEED Mobile.  The Group’s retail presence in  Europe and the US has also been  strengthened. In April 2006, the  Group signed a retail agreement  with Avanquest, a leading global  publisher of best-selling personal  and professional software  marketed in over 100 countries,  for France and Spain gaining a  retail presence in key multiples  including FNAC, Boulanger and  through select online portals  such as Bluesquad and Blitzbox.  In February 2007, we appointed  Navarre (NASDAQ: NAVR), a  leading distributor of home enter- tainment PC software in the US.  In June 2006, we announced an  extension to the agreement with  BT to distribute ONSPEED to BT’s  512kb Broadband base, giving  these customers up to 5 times  faster connectivity with ONSPEED  Version 5. The Group continues to  use these high profile relationships  to further improve its awareness  and credibility to a wider interna- tional audience.  Marketing spend on ONSPEED  represented 29% of total Group  indirect costs, representing a  continuation of the historically  efficient use of marketing. With  targeted media buying and  innovative in-house analysis, cost  per sale equated to an efficient  £6.76 compared to £8.04 in 2006.  To further increase ARPU across  the ONSPEED base, we launched  an ONSPEED toolbar in February  2007, providing more value to the  ONSPEED product as well as a  search box powered by YAHOO! to  capitalise on search revenue from  the ONSPEED base. The benefit  of this added capability will be  reflected in next year’s results.  ONSPEED Mobile The ONSPEED Mobile product  became commercially available   in March 2006 via Internet  subscription and through existing  UK distribution channels, including  Amazon, PC World, Play and  Staples. ONSPEED Mobile has  received wide acclaim in the trade  press, many of whom believe that  demand will be triggered by the  current expense of accessing the  Internet via mobile devices – the  same driver behind the original   success of ONSPEED.  07 Ë “ONSPEED Mobile has  received wide acclaim  in the trade press” Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 JOiNT CHiEf EXECUTivES’ ST aTEmENT Fifteen publications have  presented upbeat reviews,  some granting 5 star awards,  notably Computer Active, Stuff  and WebUser. Although direct  consumer sales have been slow  to materialise, the Directors  believe in the size and strength  of the mobile Internet market  and feel ONSPEED Mobile is  well-positioned to benefit from  longer term consumer take-up. In  addition, deeper market penetra- tion will take place via partnership  with mobile network operators  as demonstrated by a diverse  pipeline of potential partners and  jurisdictions. OnShare The Group has continued to  invest significantly in OnShare,  the proprietary file sharing  software. The development of  OnShare over the last 12 months  has seen a series of continuous  improvements to the design  and functionality of the OnShare  product, with focus on building  stability and ease of use. In  addition, significant R&D has been  invested in OnShare’s underlying  protocol, “ActiveStream”. This  proprietary IP will be re-used and  is set to become the basis for  future consumer and corporate  product development.  OnShare was launched to a test  group of users in March 2006, with  subsequent upgrades through the  year. This test identified a number  of required improvements prior  to launch and in February 2007  a soft launch was implemented  providing users with free access  to the product which included a  mechanism to encourage viral  marketing. The growth in users  has exceeded budget and based  on this trend, we plan to commer- cialise the product with marketing  support around the middle of  the current financial year. Share- holders will be informed at the  commencement of this initiative  and will be regularly updated as   to progress. Net2Roam Net2Roam continues to provide  a consistent revenue stream,  with very little requirement for  additional resources or marketing  budget. Relaunched in February  2007 using iPass (NASDAQ: IPAS)  infrastructure, Net2Roam added  76,000 Wi-Fi hotspots in 68  countries to its offering. COST SaviNgS aNd  pErfOrmaNCE iN THE  CUrrENT fiNaNCiaL yEar A cost saving plan was imple- mented starting in January 2007,  based on a staff redundancy  programme, continuing focus  on efficient marketing spend,  streamlining server use across  our portfolio of products and  negotiating better terms with   our suppliers.  As a result of these costs   savings, our unaudited manage- ment accounts for the first two  months of the current financial   year show a 30% reduction in  administrative costs year-on-year.  In addition, consolidated sales  for quarter one of the current year  are ahead of budget. OUTLOOk The extended test launch of  OnShare, although putting us  behind our original plan at the  time of admission to AIM, has  resulted in a stronger offering to  consumers. OnShare offers several  unique features to consumers and  to SMEs which the Group intends  to take full advantage of in the   “great” “(ONSPEED Mobile is) a great way to bring  the web to your mobile phone, it works  extremely well”  Personal Computer World,   Product Of The Week Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 coming months. Additionally,  the R&D invested in OnShare’s  underlying proprietary protocol,  “ActiveStream” is well-placed  to be used in other products  developed by the Group to drive  future revenue streams.  Mobile Internet usage is the  key driver to ONSPEED Mobile,  our other recent product, which  uses proprietary compression  technology to enable more  efficient access to the Internet,   and we are confident of the  conclusion of operator agreements  and healthy consumer demand in   the coming year. The Group has continued to  identify commercial opportuni- ties for new technologies and  to develop products that satisfy  consumer needs. We have a  confirmed launch plan for two new  and exciting software products  that adhere to our high margin,  pre-paid criteria. The sentiment within the Group is  one of excitement for the current  financial year, with a focus on  maintaining our core businesses,  exploiting the Group’s IP and  developing a new pipeline of  products with a more efficient  cost-base.

              "'  04 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT JOHN STANDEN Non-Executive Chairman  “ We ended the year with a clear focus for the future  – to continue to invest in new licensed technologies  and to continue to create our own Intellectual Property.” I am pleased to report our ﬁ rst full ﬁ nancial results since  Z GROUP’s successful admission to trading on the  London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market  in June 2005.  RESULTS Our results demonstrate that our business model is delivering  substantial growth. Turnover has increased by 63% to  £5.0 million compared with £3.1 million for the 11-month period  ended 28 February 2005, as annualised for comparison  purposes. Gross margin was consistent with previous  periods of trading at 78% and we made a record full year  pre-tax proﬁ t of £1.1 million (2005: £0.6 million). After a substantial investment of £0.9 million in our new  products and the related websites, we ended the year with  cash resources of £4.1 million, compared to £4.6 million  immediately following the Placing in June 2005. CORPORATE STRATEGY We develop and sell innovative web-enabled technologies  which meet an identified growing mass market need.  In the last ﬁ nancial year our major priorities have been  to invest in our ground-breaking new products OnShare  and ONSPEED Mobile, while selling ONSPEED into  an ever-widening marketplace. We ended the year with  over half a million customers worldwide and a clear focus  for the future – to continue to invest in new licensed  technologies and to continue to create our own IP . BOARD AND PEOPLE At the time of our Placing we stated that we would expand  the Board by recruiting a Chair for our Audit Committee.  We are pleased to announce that Polly Williams will be joining  the Board from 6 July 2006. Polly Williams will bring  considerable experience to this role and we look forward  to welcoming her onto the Board. We are continuing the search for a Finance Director to join  our Board. In the meantime, we have been fortunate to  have excellent assistance in this regard and anticipate that  by the end of the financial year we will have appointed  a new Finance Director. We have seen a steady increase in the number of staff  working at Z GROUP with over 35 people now working  for the Group. Without these staff members and the  unique skills each brings to the Group, it would not have  been possible for us to achieve these record results. Their  hard work, commitment and innovation have been the key  to Z GROUP’s success. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Part of Z GROUP’s philosophy is to work to the highest  ethical standards, wherever possible – this includes  its relationships with staff and customers and all those  who may have dealings with the Group. We actively support  a small start-up charity and provide encouragement  to those staff involved. Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006  05 Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 “ Turnover has increased  by 63% to £5.0 million  compared with  £3.1 million for the year  ended 28 February 2005  and we made a record  full year pre-tax proﬁ t of  £1.1 million ending the  year with cash resources  of £4.1 million.” PROSPECTS Z GROUP continues to identify commercial opportunities  for new technologies and to develop products that satisfy  consumer needs. During the ﬁ rst month of the new ﬁ nancial  year we have successfully released two new products:  ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare (as a beta release) and  their current performance is meeting our expectations.  In ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare we have two new exciting  products that we anticipate will address the growing  consumer demand for mobile Internet and file sharing  services, which are predicted to grow exponentially over  the next few years. We are well positioned to satisfy this  consumer demand and we are looking forward to another  successful year.  JOHN STANDEN Non-Executive Chairman 30 May 2006  “ Broadband speeds on a 56k modem may seem like  fantasy, but amazingly it does work.”  “ Performance 5/5, Ease of use 5/5, Value 5/5, Rating 5/5.” Internet and Broadband Advisor magazine “ I am pleased to report our ﬁ rst ﬁ nancial results since  Z GROUP’s successful admission to trading on  AIM in June 2005. Our results demonstrate that  our business model is delivering substantial growth.” '"

OVERVIEW This is our  rst Annual Report since joining AIM and we are  pleased to announce that we have achieved further  improvement in our pro ts this year, our third consecutive  year of growth, with a pre-tax pro t of 1.1 million. This  success has been the result of consolidating our core  business, developing new delivery channels and expanding  into European and other international markets. We have  also made signi cant investment in our product portfolio,  both by licensing new technologies to commercialise  and by developing in-house proprietary technologies to  address the needs of mass consumer markets. AIMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Our primary aim this year was to increase our turnover  and profits whilst investing in the business to expand  our product portfolio. We are pleased to report that we  have achieved success in both endeavours. This growth  is a result of continued sales from ONSPEED and a sustained  revenue contribution from our other products.  By developing a number of new routes to market, through  both retail and af liate partnerships, as well as expanding our  customer base abroad, we have achieved signi cant sales  growth. In addition, we continue to maintain high customer  retention levels through the provision of unique and affordable  software services and excellent customer support. We have laid the foundations for the future this year through  sizeable investment in research and development. This  has resulted in the recent launch of ONSPEED Mobile and  the release of our revolutionary  le sharing software OnShare. Our  rst products Net2Roam and NetAway have provided  a consistent revenue stream, with very little requirement  for additional resources or marketing budget. It has been  through the success of these products that we have also  established strong relationships with distributors and retailers  that have been bene cial in the development of new routes  to market for ONSPEED both in the UK and abroad. Onbidder was also launched this year, and although  it only accounts for a small percentage of our revenue,  it also sells both online and through retail outlets, further  strengthening the Groups brand position with major  retailers and consumers alike. ONSPEED has continued to perform very well throughout  the year and we now have over half a million customers.  Online sales have grown, continuing to account for the majority  of sales both in the UK and abroad. Of ine sales increased  with the publication of a retail version of ONSPEED, which  is now sold in most major retailers in the UK and Europe.  The Group further developed its Internet acceleration software  for Dial-up and Broadband, with the release in January 2006   07 Z GROUP plc  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006  By developing a number  of new routes to market,  through both retail and  af liate partnerships as  well as expanding our  customer base abroad  we have achieved  signi cant sales growth.  We continue to maintain  high customer retention  levels through the  provision of unique and  highly affordable software  services and excellent  customer support. of ONSPEED Version 5, which delivers 40% faster Internet  connection speeds. The addition of ONSPEED Version 5  has allowed us to market the product more effectively to  Broadband customers in addition to the existing Dial-up  customer base.

              "'  04 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT JOHN STANDEN Non-Executive Chairman   We ended the year with a clear focus for the future   to continue to invest in new licensed technologies  and to continue to create our own Intellectual Property. I am pleased to report our  rst full  nancial results since  Z GROUPs successful admission to trading on the  London Stock Exchanges Alternative Investment Market  in June 2005.  RESULTS Our results demonstrate that our business model is delivering  substantial growth. Turnover has increased by 63% to  5.0 million compared with 3.1 million for the 11-month period  ended 28 February 2005, as annualised for comparison  purposes. Gross margin was consistent with previous  periods of trading at 78% and we made a record full year  pre-tax pro t of 1.1 million (2005: 0.6 million). After a substantial investment of 0.9 million in our new  products and the related websites, we ended the year with  cash resources of 4.1 million, compared to 4.6 million  immediately following the Placing in June 2005. CORPORATE STRATEGY We develop and sell innovative web-enabled technologies  which meet an identified growing mass market need.  In the last  nancial year our major priorities have been  to invest in our ground-breaking new products OnShare  and ONSPEED Mobile, while selling ONSPEED into  an ever-widening marketplace. We ended the year with  over half a million customers worldwide and a clear focus  for the future  to continue to invest in new licensed  technologies and to continue to create our own IP . BOARD AND PEOPLE At the time of our Placing we stated that we would expand  the Board by recruiting a Chair for our Audit Committee.  We are pleased to announce that Polly Williams will be joining  the Board from 6 July 2006. Polly Williams will bring  considerable experience to this role and we look forward  to welcoming her onto the Board. We are continuing the search for a Finance Director to join  our Board. In the meantime, we have been fortunate to  have excellent assistance in this regard and anticipate that  by the end of the financial year we will have appointed  a new Finance Director. We have seen a steady increase in the number of staff  working at Z GROUP with over 35 people now working  for the Group. Without these staff members and the  unique skills each brings to the Group, it would not have  been possible for us to achieve these record results. Their  hard work, commitment and innovation have been the key  to Z GROUPs success. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Part of Z GROUPs philosophy is to work to the highest  ethical standards, wherever possible  this includes  its relationships with staff and customers and all those  who may have dealings with the Group. We actively support  a small start-up charity and provide encouragement  to those staff involved.

PROSPECTS Z GROUP continues to identify commercial opportunities  for new technologies and to develop products that satisfy  consumer needs. During the  rst month of the new  nancial  year we have successfully released two new products:  ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare (as a beta release) and  their current performance is meeting our expectations.  In ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare we have two new exciting  products that we anticipate will address the growing  consumer demand for mobile Internet and file sharing  services, which are predicted to grow exponentially over  the next few years. We are well positioned to satisfy this  consumer demand and we are looking forward to another  successful year.

OVERVIEW This is our rst Annual Report since joining AIM and we are pleased to announce that we have achieved further improvement in our pro ts this year, our third consecutive year of growth, with a pre-tax pro t of 1.1 million. This success has been the result of consolidating our core business, developing new delivery channels and expanding into European and other international markets. We have also made signi cant investment in our product portfolio, both by licensing new technologies to commercialise and by developing in-house proprietary technologies to address the needs of mass consumer markets. AIMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Our primary aim this year was to increase our turnover and profits whilst investing in the business to expand our product portfolio. We are pleased to report that we have achieved success in both endeavours. This growth is a result of continued sales from ONSPEED and a sustained revenue contribution from our other products. By developing a number of new routes to market, through both retail and af liate partnerships, as well as expanding our customer base abroad, we have achieved signi cant sales growth. In addition, we continue to maintain high customer retention levels through the provision of unique and affordable software services and excellent customer support. We have laid the foundations for the future this year through sizeable investment in research and development. This has resulted in the recent launch of ONSPEED Mobile and the release of our revolutionary le sharing software OnShare. Our rst products Net2Roam and NetAway have provided a consistent revenue stream, with very little requirement for additional resources or marketing budget. It has been through the success of these products that we have also established strong relationships with distributors and retailers that have been bene cial in the development of new routes to market for ONSPEED both in the UK and abroad. Onbidder was also launched this year, and although it only accounts for a small percentage of our revenue, it also sells both online and through retail outlets, further strengthening the Groups brand position with major retailers and consumers alike. ONSPEED has continued to perform very well throughout the year and we now have over half a million customers. Online sales have grown, continuing to account for the majority of sales both in the UK and abroad. Of ine sales increased with the publication of a retail version of ONSPEED, which is now sold in most major retailers in the UK and Europe. The Group further developed its Internet acceleration software for Dial-up and Broadband, with the release in January 2006  07 Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 By developing a number of new routes to market, through both retail and af liate partnerships as well as expanding our customer base abroad we have achieved signi cant sales growth.

              "' VPhase plc  Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 05 Chief Executive’s Review I am delighted to report that the Group has successfully delivered its key objective of positioning its first product VX1 to be ready for the next stage of commercialisation in 2009 and to place VX1 in an Ofgem Demonstration Action programme. This programme has been fully funded by SSE to a value of up to £240,000, and it is anticipated that these trials of VX1 will demonstrate significant carbon dioxide savings when used in UK domestic properties. Additionally, the Group is starting a programme of commercial partnerships to introduce VPhase initially to European and then to other geographic markets. We have already entered into a memorandum of understanding with British Gas to consider routes to market for VPhase products in the UK and also into North America through Direct Energy, one of America’s leading integrated energy companies and another Centrica-owned business. We have also initiated dialogue with consumer unit manufacturers, social housing organisations and energy  efficiency companies. Furthermore, we have examined both technically and commercially the potential to expand the VPhase technology platform to additional products and markets. Whilst we are focussed on delivering the VX1 product, we believe that further products can be readily produced for delivery into a wider range of geographical markets such as North America and dedicated to high-end energy saving applications. We have filed another patent on the basis of development work carried out that expands the potential footprint, and the protection, for our Smart Voltage Management technology. The Group has made excellent progress in 2008, having established an experienced in-house team and working with a specialist provider for design for manufacture and initial volume manufacturing services, culminating in the trade launch of the Group’s first product VX1. The VX1 product was previewed at a trade launch at the Interbuild Exhibition held in October 2008. Interest in the product and the principles of Smart Voltage Management was strong from a broad section of the building and property industry, and the Group is currently recruiting additional sales resource to respond to this demand. Our progress in 2008  has been substantial  and provides the soundest of foundations for commercial success  in 2009. We are excited about  the relationships we have built with SSE and British Gas and are extremely confident about the future of VPhase. VPhase announces Ofgem approval for trialing of the VPhase VX1 product under the UK Government’s Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) scheme in partnership with Scottish and Southern Energy. “We are looking forward to confirming the energy and carbon saving capability of the VPhase VX1 device and subsequently making the product available to SSE customers.” Paul Wilkins, Energy Efficiency Team Leader for SSE VPhase plc signs a memorandum of understanding with British Gas to distribute  the VPhase energy saving product – subject to successful trials. “This MoU is another step in British Gas  putting in place a range of low carbon energy technologies and products for our residential, business and public sector customers. These technologies will become increasingly important as UK consumers seek to become more energy efficient.” Gearoid Lane, Managing Director of British Gas New Energy, leading the product trials on behalf of British Gas Services 12065 Vphase FRONT.indd  5 17/4/09  19:38:53 VPhase plc  Group Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 06 We achieved or exceeded our goals in 2008 and I look forward to repeating this success in 2009.

In May 2008, the Group raised £3.5 million (gross) by way of a placing of 70 million ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each, comprising 10.1% of the enlarged issued share capital, at a price of 5 pence per share. This share placing has enabled the Group to accelerate the time and access to routes to market, and to investigate other potential opportunities for Smart Voltage Management, such as further domestic and small commercial applications and other geographic regions. The Group has teamed with the two biggest utility companies in the UK who jointly supply energy to around 40% of UK households. The Group continues to exercise strong cash management and ends the year with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet and a well defined route forward to commercialisation, with a view to delivering growth and shareholder value. Key priorities for 2009 include the CE marking of VX1; the expansion of our capacity to supply; capitalising on market opportunities to generate revenue; and the development of further products utilising our Smart Voltage Management technology. Overall, we expect 2009 to be another year of progress and growth for VPhase plc and I look forward to updating you on our progress at the time of our interims.
